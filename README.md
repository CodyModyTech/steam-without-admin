# Steam No-Admin Installer

This project provides a **batch script** (`.bat`) that allows you to install **Steam** on a computer **without administrator rights**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**  
- This is **not an official Steam installer**.  
- Some features will not work, especially games with **anti-cheat systems** (e.g., VAC, Easy Anti-Cheat, BattleEye).  
- Use this at your own risk.

## üì• How to Use

1. Download the official **[SteamSetup.exe](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)** from Valve.  
2. Place **`SteamSetup.exe`** in the **same folder** as the `.bat` script.  
3. Run the `.bat` file.  

The script will handle the install process without requiring admin rights.

## ‚ö° Important Notes

- **Do not install Steam into `C:\Program Files` or any other admin-restricted folder.**  
  - Instead, choose a folder in your **user directory** (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourName>\Steam` or `D:\Steam`).  
- **Anti-cheat limitations**: You will **not be able to play games that use anti-cheat software**.  
- Works best for single-player and non-anti-cheat multiplayer games.
